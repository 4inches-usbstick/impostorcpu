# ImpostorCPU
## [sus]

Program designed to mimic an actual CPU, or at least try to get close to it. Comes prepackaged with a
human to machine code converter and no bus functionality (special memory addresses are used for this).

This project is probably being suspended soon, as I
A. start a new school that I'll be in for at least 4 years
B. flame myself far too hard for the program's inaccuracies
