00000104: outbound bus 1
00000108: outbound bus 2
0000010C: inbound bus 1
00000110: inbound bus 2
(we don't have names for these buses so in theory you can use them for whatever)

We have a file that stores the 'memory'. And we also have a secondary bus that also does memhandler calls.
This way, instead of everyone writing through memory.txt, everyone uses memhandler calls and we use one file stream.

This will be done in the CPU file to prevent simul. multiaccess as a result of hardware. As it executes instructions
it also checks the 'bus file' for new instructions from hardware. This will most likely be done in a cheap manner by
loading the instruction into the next one in the pile.

Write to a certain 32bit address and a bus handler will send the data outbound. Send a command inbound and the bus handler will modify the memory for you.
