# ImpostorCPU
## [sus]

Program designed to mimic an actual CPU, or at least try to get close to it. Basic operations like move memory, do math, etc. mimic the real thing, but the way that everything connect (buses, etc.) is nowhere near real. And no, I didn't name it ImpostorCPU just to make amoogus jokes
